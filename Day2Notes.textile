h1. Drupal Commerce

* Freestyle, unconstrained approach to e-commerce
* Large use of Rules, Views, Entities, and References
* Need to focus on documentation
** DrupalCommerce.org
* Commerce Kickstart Drupal Installation Profile
** Provides everything installed and configured
* Features
** Product Attributes are fields
*** A product can be selected on the backend through a form just providing field widgets
*** The combination of the selected attributes selects the appropriate product
** Fields on a line item allow personalization of products (like name for engraving on an iPod)
** The cart is a view
** Checkout is built through a drag and drop form builder
** Shipping module allows any number of flat rate shipping services
** Use Rules to determine is shipping should be free based on cart attributes
** Auto account creation for anonymous
*** Since everything happens through Rules you can change all of this by just disabling a rule
* Tech Demo
** Price field for line item
*** Include field on add to cart form checkbox
** Need to tell the system to use the donation field in the product pricing rule
*** "Calculating the sale price of a line item"
* Bulk add product module to help easily create all of the skis based on product attributes

h1. Omega

* The starting documentation point: http://drupal.org/node/819164
* Delta inheritance is currently broken, looking to change it to work like views overrides
* Turn off debugging blocks right away!
* Create a subtheme of Omega

h1. View Modes

* Theme faster
* Write less PHP
* Easily reusable layouts
* Named ways of displaying Entities
** "Full"
** "Photo Teaser"
** "Subtitle Teaser"
** Different displays of the same node
* Core
* Work well with Views
* Built in to all Entities
* Too many templates, @template.php@ is out of control, using views to do theming
* Built-in include Default and Teaser for Nodes
* full, RSS, search index, search results
* Manage Display
** Custom Display Settings
* All node types in one template
* Entity View Mode
** Simple, lightweight way to define additional view modes
** Not good for Features
* Display Suite
** Better exporting in Features
** Huge module
* Defining View Modes in Code
** @hook_entity_info_alter@
* Per View Mode you can completely customize Manage Display
* Field Group can be used to then group the View Modes fields
* Node Reference
** Settings allow you to select the View Mode (Gear Box)
* Views
** Display Content not Fields
** Select the View Mode
* Search results is a View Mode
* Search index is a View Mode
* Consistent design is important
** Grid based
** Repeating
* http://bit.ly/view-modes

h1. Migrate

* Powerful object oriented framework for moving content in to Drupal
* Migrate 2.0
** Migrate Extras
** @beer.inc@ and @wine.inc@ are the most comprehensive examples
* Creates one destination record for each source record
* Keeps track of the original ids/keys so that a migration can be re-run or rolled back
* In Practice
** Create a new module so you can enable, run, and then disable
** Implement @hook_migrate_api@ in the @.module@ file
** Create a class that extends Migration
** Setup a source and a destination
** Check the slides for all of the code examples

h1. Entities

* Fields everywhere
* Bundles
** Subtype of Entity
** Entity type -> Node / Bundle -> Node type
** Entity type -> Taxonomy term / Bundle -> Vocabulary
* Shift from Node modules to Entity modules
* Unified way to access data
** i.e. Rules -> Entities -> (Comment, Node, User, Profile, Product)
* Interacting with Entities
** Entity API module
** @entity_metadata_wrapper@
* Property Info
** Validation
** Access Information
* Providing an Entity Type
** Implemente @hook_entity_info@
** Specify 'controller class'
** Implement @hook_schema@
* Profile2 is an example
* Remote entities are possible
** NoSQL, Doctrine, PHPCR
** Non-database entities + fields?
*** Fields will be stored in the local Drupal database
* http://drupal.org/sandbox/fago/1493180
* Remote Entities can have non-integer ids if they are not fieldable
